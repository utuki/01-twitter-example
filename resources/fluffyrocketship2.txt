In the milky region of outer space
The fluffy rocket ship is lost,
But it never shows the black fridge,
And it never hides the freaky paper clip.
For its glass shield hologram
The fluffy rocket ship synchronized the baboon,
And it drowned in interplanetary pixel trees,
So that the milky mustache befriended a can.
But there stands a kind gamma ray
And it bursts out unmanned space dust,
And it sings for the neutron nebula,
And it fights the chewing gum rebels,
For its love for popular explosives.
The fluffy rocket ship has a brain,
Never forget,
Never forget about intergalactic roller-coasters,
And the sentient asteroid.
In the hole where a chubby dwarf planet lives
And the light straw bubble wrap that sings
For its unnamed robot kittens,
For its sticky octopus hair,
And the mass of a black neutron moon,
The fluffy rocket ship keeps a pile of friendly asteroids.
We may build a ship shipping ship
For the levitating hyrax,
Never forget the mouse in the jar,
And the suspicious chain of atoms.
The fluffy rocket ship has infinite rooms
For the unannounced interstellar strawberry jam,
In the funky clock that has no strings.
Never forget where you put your towel
And the special board of wooden rubber,
So that we see the ship shipping ship.
We may build a humongous laser snake
For the atomic useless moon bridge,
So that we synchronize the space beavers.
