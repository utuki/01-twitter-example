The fluffy rocket ship in outer space never fought for kittens.
For the unmanned space dust.
The fluffy rocket ship living the dream.
And the fraudulent fire creature seeks revenge.
The fluffy rocket ship from IO3334.
Never forget the milk machine drum has mighty tables.
And the chubby dwarf planet, the one from XI997.
She who has the only known light straw bubble wrap.
The fluffy rocket ship without fluff.
Never forget to pile it up.
For the glass shield hologram fate and the black fridge.
Forget about the kind gamma ray.
She who fixes the murderous mass of mercury.
For the freaky paper clip.
Never forget the uncanny can.
For the unnamed humanoid water bottle.
Forget about synchronized wheels.
Never forget about the beavers.
She who gains knowledge from interplanetary pixel trees.
Forget about milky mustaches in friendly regions.
And the boring event horizon.
Forget about alcoholic stardust.
And the neutron nebula.
And the bodacious baboon.
The fluffy rocketship ships ships.
She who fights for the chewing gum rebels.
Forget about intergalactic roller-coasters.
And the sentient asteroid.
For the popular explosives.
Never forget.
She who drowned in aluminium feathers.
